In Module One, you will be introduced to basic text mining tasks, and will be able to interpret text in terms of its 
building blocks – i.e. words and sentences, and reading in text files, processing text, and addressing common issues 
with unstructured text. You will also learn how to write regular expressions to find and extract words and concepts 
that follow specific textual patterns. You will be introduced to UTF-8 encoding and how multi-byte characters are 
handled in Python. This week’s assignment will focus on identifying dates using regular expressions and normalize them.
